# Time-Independent-Case
This Python code solves the 1D time-independent Schr√∂dinger equation for a particle in a box with infinite potential walls using the finite difference method. The goal is to compute the energy eigenvalues and corresponding wavefunctions, and then visualize the probability density (squared wavefunction) for the first few energy levels.
